    question: 'What is extrnode?',
    answer:
      'extrnode is a battle-tested decentralized RPC gateway powered by Everstake, a responsible validator trusted by 625k users across 70+ blockchain networks.',
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I use extrnode's open-source load balancer for production applications?",
    answer:
      'While Solana public RPC nodes are available freely and to anyone, there is no guarantee that they will operate as you expect. Everstake and extrnode do not control those nodes in any way, and we donâ€™t recommend using them for production applications. Therefore, you can use those nodes only at your own risk and discretion.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are your future plans?',
    answer:
      'Soon, we will release extrnode Premium. It will have only RPC nodes run by battle-tested validators, like Everstake, 01node, Chainflow, Imperator, Chainode Tech, Stakin, Staking Facilities, to provide clients with higher communication speeds and reliability.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you protect your public load balancer from outages?',
    answer:
      'The balancer has the entire fault-tolerant routing set up. And to ensure 99.9% uptime, we added RPC nodes hosted by Everstake, 01node, Stakin, and Chainstack to the cluster.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are you going to have a token?',
    answer:
      'There might be a governance token to reinforce decentralization through competition further and ensure fair remuneration for the work of node operators. It would incentivize validators to act honestly, promote fair competition, and make the ecosystem more resilient and reliable. Other utilities, such as granting the right to accept new node operators through a vote, are discussable.',
